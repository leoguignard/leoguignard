### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ([job opportunities](https://www.guignardlab.com/jobs))

I am a theoretical *computer scientist by training* and a *biologist by experience*.

---
I try to improve our understanding of embryo morphogenesis: how cells arrange in tissues, tissues in organs and eventually organs in fully functional organisms.
I am doing so by developing novel computational ways of quantifying and visualising whole embryos at the single cell scale.
I develop in Python and work mainly in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Graph Theory.

I also teach Python to futur biologists at Aix-Marseille University.

I am the head of the group [Computer Science, Morphogenesis and Variability](https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/team/computer-science-morphogenesis-and-variability/) at the [Developmental Biology Institute of Marseille](https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/), in Marseille.

You can find more information about my group on its [official webpage](https://www.guignardlab.com).
